# First 

After I received the assignment, I take a good look at what it was asking me to do.
fist a list view and then a more detailed view. I also looked at the API as well.

I wanted to use an Accordion to display the list view and also the detailed view. Accordion gives more detailed information once its collapsed, and
by default the list view gives a good view of all the avilable jobs, without overwhelming the user with so much information.

To do that I used Material ui library. Since its a very common used library for react apps.

Another approach was to make a modal that by clikcing it will open up the jobs in a more detailed view.

# Second 

I decided use a map and display the address, I waned to make it more challenging and it will be better for the user to able to see where they have to go on the map.

The challenge here here was that I was using google maps and I needed to convert the address to latitude and longitude in order to be able to display them on the map and this has to happen on the page load.

# final 

to deoploy the app to github pages and add some responsiveness to the app.
